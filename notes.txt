jingles/music:

this is kind of a wish list, in order of preference (I don't necessarily expect to get everything).  I might be able to just squeeze in the "story mode" (with a very, very minimal story lol).  so a boss theme could be kinda cool.  

events/jingles:
score a goal
win a match
win a game
touch a mushroom (grow bigger?)
touch a star (move faster?)
unlock a new character

songs?
boss theme
character introduction / attract mode
credits? (30s) (currently using the character select music)
high score?  (20s) (currently using the "start game" jingle - it works ok)

gameplay loop:
classic - 2 players, no items, use screen edges (make this first)
story - 1 player, fight each character in order, Wuppy is the final boss (?)
battle - 2-4 players, items, high scores, unlock garfield and craig as characters
